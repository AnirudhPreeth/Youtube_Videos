# This is the notes for the tutorial. 

'''
API - Application Programming Interface. Web APIs. Interface - GIU(Graphical User Interface). 
Interface - The details are abstracted to the user, but the user is still in control of what has been determined that the user can handle. 
Interfaces evolve over time. 
GUI - Graphical User Interface. Buttons are an interface. They provide the developer the means of controlling its interactions while... 
...abstracting way how that actually works, implementation wise.
What interfaces have in common - They all define ways for us to interact or communicate with an object, whether that object be physical...
...or software, and as a user of the interface, we don't need to understand the implementation, we don't need to know how it works.
We just need to know what we've been allowed to change or see, interfaces abstract away the implementation.

UI - User Interface. 
API is a contract of sorts. It defines how it is expected to be used and it defines what you can expect to receive by using it. 
API - Web Based API. Mostly. Frameworks provide an API that allow you to extend what has been provided to make it your own.

Remote APIs - Computational power. Insanely fast. Remote APIs are designed to interact through a communications network. 
By remote, we mean that the resources being manipulated by the API are somewhere outside the computer making the request.
REST - Representational State Transfer. GraphQL. APIs written in REST style. 

Browser - Web Client. Connect to a server. Location in address bar. URL(Universal Resource Locator). 
Superset term - URI (Universal Resource Identifier). URL has a scheme portion - HTTP. HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol. 
Protocol - Lower level of API. HTTP verb - GET verb - used to clarify that this request will only receive data. 
No changes. Server receives request that was transferred from the client. 
Server does its work. It generates resulting webpage and sends back a response to the client (browser). 
Hyper text is text that can link to other texts. 
HTML, anchor tags. 

HTTP as it was originally designed is a stateless protocol. 
Headers. Both requests and responses have headers. 
Caching. Status code. List of HTTP header fields. List of HTTP status codes. 

Guiding Architectural Constraints required for an API to be considered RESTful -
Client-Server Architecture, Statelessness, Cache-ability, Layered System, Code on Demand, Uniform Interface.
Resource - R in URL. Reference an object. Describe just about anything that we build. 
Resources and collections. CRUD (Creating, Reading, Updating, Deleting).   
Read request. GET request to URI. JSON (Javascript Object Notation).
JSON provides a great way to structure and nest your data. 
JSON string into a native object. Other HTTP verbs are available. 
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
Mashup. Many APIs are available. API calls. 

Spotify For-Developers. SDK(Software Development Kit).
API provides a set of endpoints, each with its own unique path. 
Curl, which you can use from your command line. 
Authentication Error Object. Response Status Codes.  
OAuth Token. GET Token. Don't let your Token out. 

Curl is an open source tool that is used to send data back and forth and it runs locally on your computer. 
Terminal. Tokens can expire. Copy Pasta.  
URL Encoding. Some APIs are the product.   

Twilio (Company).
